Hi! my name is Lucas Eitel. I am a 24 years old chilean Agronomyst who shows a great passion about a lot of things. 
I like martial arts (specially Judo and Jiu jitsu), videogames, movies, music and of course, coding!
I discovered that my ideal carreer path is outside of my professional field (agronomy), so I decided that I will seek
a career as a FrontEnd developer and eventually, FullStack!.

I have been coding for a few years now (I started with Python on 2019) and I have been adding tools to my skillset.
I currently manage myself on HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, Git/Github and a few other tools like Excel and Power BI (of course).

I hope you enjoy your visit to my repositories and if you are interested, contact me to leitel1@uc.cl!
